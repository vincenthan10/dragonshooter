Start Date: December 5, 2025

When my brother and I were learning Scratch, we created a mini game where you had to shoot a dragon to death while avoiding its charges, fireballs, and random lightning strikes.
I found this to be a fun game concept, and have since recreated the same game using Python, for fun, and Java, for my grade 11 final CS project, which was the one I made the
most progress on. It was actually somewhat challenging, with many of my friends and even my brother struggling to beat the level, but it's fun to play it time and time again.
I've been learning to code in JavaScript (and barely some HTML and CSS) for my previous project, elor.io, and I randomly had the idea to create a full version of this dragon game, and now that I was slightly more experienced, I thought, maybe I can turn this into a web game.
I have no idea how much progress I will make, and how often I will work on it, but I will update this repository every time I make some changes or advancements. 

Later on this README will also give a better idea of what the game actually will be.
